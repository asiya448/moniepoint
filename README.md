Frontend Engineer Translation Test
Purpose
The purpose of this test is to see how well the candidate can translate designs to actual working HTML/CSS/Javascript i.e. a working web application. Half of the time, client-facing engineers (web and mobile developers) will be translating designs to code. We want to be sure that candidates can accurately translate a design task given to a very high standard.
Task
URL:https://dribbble.com/shots/23402072-Ramos-Website-design-for-digital-business-analytic-platform
 
The Task
●	You are to come up with a desktop-only (non-responsive) translation of the dribble design. 
●	All the pages/states shown in the video are to be implemented.
●	Make sure to imitate all the scroll behaviors, effects and animations as accurately as you can.
What to Look Out For
A design for a sample product website was picked at random from Dribbble (URL above). 
How well you do will be based on both the accuracy of your translation efforts (i.e. how close the result looks compared to the actual design) and the quality of your animations (i.e. the movement of elements on the page compared to the video on Dribbble).
The test is very objective, the closer you are to the source material, the higher your chances of passing the test. 
Considerations
Fonts
As this is an image, you cannot get the exact font used. Feel free to use a similar font. Find something suitable from Google fonts to use (https://fonts.google.com).
Assets
For the logos, avatars and icons, please find suitable replacements for them or crop them from the images on Dribbble (whichever yields the best results). Be mindful of using appropriate aspect ratios.
Responsiveness
You do not need to worry about making this responsive for mobile. The web version is enough.
Technologies
Feel free to use any framework you want (e.g. Angular, React, Jquery, Vanilla Javascript, etc.), as long as it is done entirely by you from the ground up and is not designed and auto-generated in some sort of studio application e.g. Dreamweaver (in which case the candidate will fail instantly). However, you can use libraries to help with some effects and sections of the application.
End Result
When complete, the candidate MUST HOST their effort on a public domain (look for something free). DO NOT send the files of your project as submission, they will not be examined nor run. When done, simply send the URLs (hosted effort and repository) to the following emails: recruitment@teamapt.com, cc perpetual.ibe@teamapt.com.
The candidate must include a link to the repository of their effort.
The candidate must make sure that everything submitted is publicly available.
Timeframe
Candidates are expected to have something to submit after 4 days (including weekends). Subject to extenuating circumstances, leeway of 1 day extra may be granted. 
Such circumstances must be communicated via email at least 24 hours before the submission deadline.
